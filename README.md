## Goals
- Create a program that can be used to understand the maximum house that a user could afford in year y given the savings and income that they had in year x.
- Practice building out HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from scratch.
- Practice using git to track changes.
## Requirements
- As a user, I can enter my savings and income, and specify a base year (e.g. 1980) and target year (e.g. 2023), so I can understand how much my savings and income in the base year are worth in the target year.
- As a user, I can see the maximum price of a house I could afford in the target year, so I can better understand what my purchasing power would be in the target year.
